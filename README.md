This working repository explores battery energy storage system models, and some exploration code on using the model in optimization and control programs.

Note: This is still a development repository.

** Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) **

## Discussion of Battery Models ##
Many published reviews have details on the classification of BESS models. Typically, models are classified by their models complexity, or their chemical models.
